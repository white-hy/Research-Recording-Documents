\section{The tasks I have finished this week}
This week I still mainly focus on the implementation of Faster R-CNN, I read the industrialized source code of Faster R-CNN(in Caffe), do a report about the problems of implementation and try to write a Faster R-CNN with pytorch myself.\\
\vspace*{.3cm}

\noindent I think I have spent too much time on it, but I quite think that my effort on Faster R-CNN is valuable, for I can reuse this framework in all of other tasks, and I can also transfer the framework to 3D Faster R-CNN easily.\\

\section{The tasks I plan to do next week}
Next week I will train my net and mainly focus on the Mask R-CNN and Focal Loss implementation, which we all think will be useful to our study.\\
\vspace*{.3cm}

\noindent I also plan to learn some mathematic theory of deep learning which I mentioned last week. I hope this can give me a board horizon on the important problem: what can deep learning do and where on earth are it's restrictions.
