## What I have done this week

This week I also mainly focus on the final exam week and some final course projects. I have 3 exams from 21st January to 25th January. Since all 3 courses are required courses and strongly related to the qualification check of the PhD recommendation and the graduate qualification, I think I have to spend some time in it.

Since Professor Danny Chen's thought is that we already have enough topics to do and what I need is to implement one or two based of the paper I have read and the ideals I have after read the papers, I totally realize that the practice in 2D Faster R-CNN (which costs me quite a few weeks to implement and I have implement it in the 2D dataset) is not the most important and related models I need to implement in current research field suggest annotation though it may and will be used in many researches afterwards, and I decided to implement one or two ideals of suggest annotation based on my ideals.

Now I decided to transfer Danny's suggest annotation structure in 3D lung nodule semantic segmentation firstly, use some 3D segmentation structures in the papers I have read and test if it can directly work in the 3D segmentation. To achieve this goal, I have done the data preprocessing jobs and some basic code this week.

## What I plan to do next week

Next 2 weeks I will focus on the exams, but I will also try to spend some time in the implementation just as I said above.
